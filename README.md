# Welcome to my Nodejs repository
Welcome to my **Nodejs** repository!
In this repository, I will document everything I learn about Node.js, including my successes and failures during the learning process, mainly using the [W3Schools website](https://w3schools.com).

Currently, I am not aiming for complex projects, but I want to start simple to better understand how Node.js works. Feel free to participate in my learning process by adding issues and helping me improve.

## What I plan to work right now:
- Create my own simple server on localhost
- Learn how to include modules (`http`, `fs`, and `url` for now)
- Try creating my own custom module as a learning exercise
- After that, I'll dive into **NPM**

## Requirements
To test my code, please make sure to install: 
- The latest version of **Node.js** (v23) | [Download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/fr/download/)
- **NPM** (included in Node.js) | [Documentation of NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/)

This repository is a learning space, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions!
