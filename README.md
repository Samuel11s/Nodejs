# Learning Node.js

This repository contains everything I'm learning about **Node.js**.  
It includes demonstration files and initial tests for each concept studied, as well as a `server/server.js` file that consolidates everything I've learned into a single file.  

---

## Repository Structure

- **Demo and test files** → Each explored concept has its own demonstration file.  
- **server/server.js** → A single file that gathers all learned concepts.  

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the files, make sure you have installed:  

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)  
- npm (included with Node.js)  

Check your installation with:  

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
